# Another version of this problem without creating any classes and variables
# Hello, #{ gets.chomp }, nice to meet you!

# TODO:
#     Write a version of the program that displays different
#     greetings for different people. This would be a good challenge to try
#     after youâ€™ve completed the exercises in
#     Chapter 4, Making Decisions, on page 29 and Chapter 7, Data Structures, on page 63.
